It is often important to know the number of days since an event.  This package provides a function for that purpose.  

As an example, some nutrition assessment methodologies are based upon the age of child in "days" to utilize a look-up table to compute z-score values for the child.

Usage possibilities include:

- DaysSinceWhen("2000-1-1")
- NumDays <- DaysSinceWhen("2000-1-1") and 
- NumDays <- as.integer(DaysSinceWhen("2000-1-1"))

## Important: Please use as.integer(DaysSinceWhen("date"")) to obtain  an integer
    value for the number of days since the date entered.

## DaysSinceWhen Code for an non-integer return value""

DaysSinceWhen <- function(dob)
   {
    DaysOld <- as.numeric(difftime(Sys.time(),dob, units = "days"))
    return(DaysOld)
    }
