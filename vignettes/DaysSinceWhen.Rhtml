<p>DaysSinceWhen("date") returns a digital value of the number of days since
the date entered.  This simple function can be enhanced if needed to include
time zones, etc. </p>

Please see the extensive details on the DaysSinceWhen() package and function in its help file  i.e. ?DaysSinceWhen

The following example may be of assistance if an integer value is needed:</p>

NumDays <- as.integer(DaysSinceWhen("2000-1-1"))</p>

Please observe the use of "as.integer()" above</p>

It is often important to know the number of days since an event.  This package provides a function for that purpose.

As an example, some nutrition assessment methodologies are based upon the age of child in "days" to utilize a look-up table to compute z-score values for the child.


Usage possibilities include:


The function implemented in the package has the same name as the package:<\p>
<!--begin.rcode
DaysSinceWhen <- function(dob) {
  DaysOld <- as.numeric(difftime(Sys.time(),dob, units = "days"))
  return(DaysOld)
}
end.rcode-->


<\p>
- DaysSinceWhen("2000-1-1")<\p>
- NumDays <- DaysSinceWhen("2000-1-1") and <\p>
- NumDays <- as.integer(DaysSinceWhen("2000-1-1")) <\p>
<\p>
Important: Please use as.integer(DaysSinceWhen("date"")) to obtain  an integer
    value for the number of days since the date entered.<\p>
<\p>
DaysSinceWhen Code for an non-integer return value<\p>
<!--begin.rcode
DaysSinceWhen <- function(dob)
   {
    DaysOld <- as.numeric(difftime(Sys.time(),dob, units = "days"))
    return(DaysOld)
    }
end.rcode-->
